python wrappers for DOLPHOT


This example makes use of 'Grid 4' ACS images from [HST-GO-12180][http://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=12180&submit=Go&observatory=HST].  
Let's assume we have the raw images from the HST archive in the 'raw' subdirectory of 'NGC6822':

``` tcsh
> pwd
NGC6822
> ls
raw/
> ls/raw/
images
```
